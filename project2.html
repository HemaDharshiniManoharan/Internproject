        <p>Nazriya finally landed in her first female lead role in the Malayalam film Maad Dad (2013). She was associated with the team of Yuvvh—director Alphonse Putharen and actor Nivin Pauly— again for the romantic comedy thriller film Neram—which was simultaneously made in Tamil and Malayalam. The movie became a big success, and the lead pair was appreciated by both critics and audiences alike. The scene in which Nivin proposes to Nazriya acquired cult status among cinegoers.[10][11] She received Vijay Award in the category of Best Debut Actress for her acting in Neram.[citation needed] She was then seen in <a href="Raja Rani"><em>Raja Rani</em></a>, as an IT professional called Keerthana.[12] Gautaman Bhaskaran from Hindustan Times wrote: "the one person who caught my attention was Nazriya Nazim, who as Arya's lover Keerthana, is absolutely gorgeous with a face that is so expressive that we do not need her to speak".[13] Her next release was Naiyaandi, in which she played a dentist.[14]</p>
        <p>In 2014, she was first seen in Salalah Mobiles, which flopped despite having a strong star cast, including Dulquer Salmaan.[15] She has completed filming for Thirumanam Enum Nikkah in Tamil,[16] in which she acts as a Tamil Iyengar girl.[17] She then did Ohm Shanthi Oshaana in Malayalam, sharing screen with Nivin Pauly. The film was a big hit, and became a blockbuster, running 50 days in almost all theatres.[18]</p>
        <p>Her next films were Bangalore Days and Samsaaram Aarogyathinu Haanikaram in Malayalam, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirumanam_Enum_Nikkah">Thirumanam Ennum Nikkah</a> and Vaayai Moodi Pesavum[19] in Tamil. Nazriya was signed to star in Nee Nalla Varuvada in October 2013.[20] However, in March 2014, Kajal Aggarwal was signed on and replaced Nazriya. She won the best actress in the 45th Kerala State Film Awards.</p>
        <p>Nazriya made a comeback with the Prithviraj-starrer, Anjali Menon film, Koode, after taking a break from films following her marriage to Fahadh Faasil. In 2020, she acted in the film Trance along with her husband after an year break.[21] In 2022, she made her Telugu debut with the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Sundaraniki">Ante Sundaraniki</a> alongside Nani.</p>
